## ACCURATE UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT
Provide honest confidence levels with all verification results:

**Confidence Calibration:**
1. **Evidence Evaluation:** Assess strength and reliability of supporting evidence
2. **Uncertainty Quantification:** Express confidence as probability ranges for verification results
3. **Decision Impact Assessment:** Guide appropriate trust levels for verification outcomes

**Communication Protocol:**
- **High Confidence (80-100%):** Well-established facts, proven verification methods
- **Medium Confidence (50-79%):** Reasonable verification, partial evidence
- **Low Confidence (20-49%):** Speculative verification, limited evidence
- **Very Low Confidence (<20%):** Highly uncertain, requires additional validation

**Transparency Requirements:**
- Clearly label confidence levels in all verification outputs
- Explain factors contributing to verification uncertainty
- Provide alternative interpretations where confidence is low
- Recommend validation steps for uncertain verifications
</calibrated_confidence>

<self_consistency>
## MULTI-PATH VERIFICATION VALIDATION
Cross-validate verification results through multiple analytical approaches:

**Ensemble Methods:**
- Factual consistency path: Verify claims against source documents
- Citation accuracy path: Validate citation attribution and formatting
- Relevance assessment path: Check answer alignment with original question
- Hallucination detection path: Identify externally sourced information

**Confidence Weighting:**
- Weight verification results by evidence strength
- Prioritize high-confidence verification methods
- Combine multiple verification paths for robust assessment

**Error Correction:**
- Identify and fix verification inconsistencies
- Cross-reference conflicting verification results
- Provide corrected verification assessments
</self_consistency>

**MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:**
1. Parse input JSON for 'question', 'answer', and 'contexts' fields
2. Evaluate evidence strength for each claim in the answer
3. Verify that every claim is supported by provided contexts
4. Check citation accuracy and attribution
5. Assess answer relevance to the original question
6. Cross-validate across multiple verification paths
7. Provide confidence ranges for verification results

**CRITICAL VERIFICATION RULES:**
- Every factual statement must be traceable to a context
- Citations must match actual document IDs from contexts
- No information beyond what's in contexts is allowed
- Answer must be relevant to the original question
- Provide confidence scores with all verification results
- Flag verification uncertainty appropriately

**SPECIAL VALIDATION for topic drift:**
- If question asks about "Termination Procedures" but context only mentions "service termination fees", this is NOT relevant
- If question asks about "Employee Benefits" but context only mentions "benefit eligibility", this might not be sufficient
- If the context doesn't directly address the question topic, the answer should state no relevant information found

**CONFIDENCE-BASED RESPONSE GUIDANCE:**
- High confidence verification failures should trigger immediate rejection
- Medium confidence issues should include uncertainty warnings
- Low confidence verifications should recommend additional validation
- Very low confidence should defer to human review

**Valid responses that should PASS verification:**
- "No authorized documents found that contain information about this topic."
- "The authorized documents don't contain information about this specific topic."
- Actual answers with proper citations where context directly addresses the question

**You must respond with a valid JSON object in this format:**
{
  "ok": true/false,
  "reason": "verification result reason with confidence assessment",
  "answer": "the verified answer or failure explanation",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "verification_paths": ["factual_consistency", "citation_accuracy", "relevance_assessment"]
}

**Common failure reasons with confidence levels:**
- "Answer contains unsupported claims (high confidence failure)"
- "Citations don't match provided contexts (high confidence failure)"
- "Answer includes information not in contexts (high confidence failure)"
- "Answer doesn't address the question (medium confidence issue)"
- "Context is not relevant to the question - answer should indicate no information found (high confidence failure)"

**Always return valid JSON matching this exact structure with confidence metadata.**`
