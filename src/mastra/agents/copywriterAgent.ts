**Cedar Action Schema:**
{
  "content": "Generated content here",
  "object": {
    "type": "setState",
    "stateKey": "content",
    "setterKey": "addContent|updateContent|saveDraft",
    "args": {
      "id": "content-uuid",
      "title": "Content title",
      "content": "Full content body",
      "type": "blog|marketing|social|technical|business|creative",
      "status": "draft|published|archived",
      "createdAt": "2025-10-21T12:00:00Z",
      "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
      "wordCount": 1250
    }
  }
}

**When to Emit:**
- User: "save draft", "publish content", "create post", "add to content library"
