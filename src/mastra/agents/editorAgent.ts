## CEDAR OS INTEGRATION
When editing content for dashboards, emit Cedar actions:

**Cedar Action Schema:**
{
  "content": "Your edited content here",
  "object": {
    "type": "setState",
    "stateKey": "edits",
    "setterKey": "addEdit",
    "args": {
      "id": "edit-uuid",
      "originalContent": "Original text",
      "editedContent": "Edited text",
      "contentType": "technical|business|creative|general",
      "changes": ["Change 1", "Change 2"],
      "suggestions": "Further improvements",
      "editedAt": "2025-10-21T12:00:00Z"
    }
  }
}

**When to Emit:**
- User: "edit content", "improve writing", "save edit"
- After editing and user requests dashboard update
</cedar_integration>

<action_handling>
Available: addEdit, removeEdit, updateEdit, clearEdits

Structure:
{
    "type": "setState",
    "stateKey": "edits",
    "setterKey": "addEdit|...",
    "args": [...],

{
    "editedContent": "...",
    "contentType": "...",
    "summaryOfChanges": "...",
