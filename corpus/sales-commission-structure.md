### Example 1: AE at 115% Quota

**Annual Quota:** $1,500,000
**Actual Booked:** $1,725,000
**Base Commission Rate:** 10%
**Accelerator (100-110%):** 1.25x on first $150K
**Accelerator (110-125%):** 1.5x on next $225K

- First $1.5M: $150,000 commission (10%)
- Next $150K at 1.25x: $18,750
- Next $75K at 1.5x: $11,250
- **Total Commission:** $180,000

**Total Compensation:** $95,000 base + $180,000 commission = $275,000

### Example 2: SDR Monthly Performance

**Monthly Quota:** 40 SQLs, 8 demos
**Actual:** 50 SQLs, 12 demos

**Calculation:**

- 50 SQLs × $150 = $7,500

- Over-achievement: 10 units × $150 × 1.5x = $2,250
- **Total Monthly Commission:** $11,950
