## Introduction

This playbook guides DeanMachines.com's AI-powered sales approach. As a solo founder, I use AI agents for 90% of sales operations, focusing on self-service signups and high-value relationships. Our pricing: Starter $49/mo, Professional $299/mo, Enterprise $1,499/mo. Near-zero costs = maximum profitability.

**Current Reality:** MVP with core RAG functionality. Focus on early adopters who need secure document search. Enterprise features (advanced integrations, audit trails) coming in Q1 2026.

## Sales Process Overview

Our sales methodology follows a lean 4-stage process optimized for solo founder:

### 1. Prospecting (100% AI-Powered)

- **Content Marketing**: AI agent writes weekly blogs (SEO for "secure RAG", "governed AI", "document search AI")
- **Social Media**: Daily Twitter/X posts, build in public, share technical learnings
- **Product Hunt**: Launch for visibility, target top 10 product of day
- **Organic Inbound**: Free 14-day trial, no credit card, self-service signup at deanmachines.com
- **GitHub**: Open source components attract developers

### 2. Qualification (95% Self-Service)

**Self-Service Onboarding:**

- Sign up → AI chatbot guides setup (10 mins) → Upload documents → Trial begins
- AI support agent handles questions 24/7 via chat
- No human touchpoint unless prospect requests demo

**High-Touch (Enterprise $1,499+ only):**

- Prospect books 15-min demo via Calendly
- I personally demo current capabilities
- AI generates custom proposal based on their document volume
- Trial with priority support
- Qualification: Can they pay? Do they have documents to search? Are they technical enough to self-onboard?

### 3. Demo & Trial

**Demo Structure (15 minutes - keep it short):**

- 3 min: Quick overview of what we've built
- 7 min: Live demo with their sample documents (if provided)
- 3 min: Pricing and next steps
- 2 min: Q&A

**Trial Strategy:**

- 14-day free trial with full feature access
- AI onboarding chatbot guides initial setup
- Email check-ins at Day 3, 7, 11
- Automatic upgrade prompts when limits approached

### 4. Close & Support

**Closing Techniques:**

- **Trial-Based Close**: "Try it free for 14 days - if it doesn't save you time, don't pay"
- **Value-Based Close**: "Replace your current document search process with AI-powered answers"
- **Momentum Close**: "Let's get you started today so you can see results this week"

**Post-Sale Support:**

- Current workaround: GitHub wiki, Notion, scattered Google Docs
- Budget: $299/mo Professional plan
- Buying signal: Uses technical terms, asks about integrations

**Secondary Buyer: Operations Manager**

- Pain: Standard operating procedures lost, process documentation outdated
- Goals: Consistent operations, faster training, compliance readiness
- Current workaround: Shared drives, email attachments, physical binders
- Budget: $299/mo Professional plan
- Buying signal: Mentions "processes", "compliance", "training"

**Enterprise Buyer: IT Director (Future)**

- Budget: $1,499/mo Enterprise plan
- Buying signal: Asks about security, compliance, user management

## Value Proposition Framework

### Core Value Pillars (MVP Focus)

**1. Time Savings (Primary Value)**

- "Find any document in seconds instead of minutes/hours of searching"
- "AI answers questions directly from your documents"
- ROI: Save 2-4 hours/week per user on document searches
- For 10 users: $200-400/month value, our $299 plan pays for itself

**2. Better Decisions (Secondary Value)**

- "Get accurate answers from your entire knowledge base"
- "Never miss important context again"
- "Consistent information access across your team"

**3. Easy Setup (Table Stakes)**

- "Upload documents, ask questions - works immediately"
- "No complex configuration or training required"
- "Integrates with Google Drive, OneDrive, or direct upload"

### Competitive Positioning

**vs. Manual Search:**

- "Stop wasting time searching - get instant answers"

**vs. Basic AI Chatbots:**

- "Trained on your actual documents, not generic knowledge"
- "Secure and private - your data never leaves your environment"

**vs. Enterprise Search (Future):**

- "Same power, 90% less complexity and cost"
- "Built for growing companies, not just enterprises"

**vs. Financial Analysis Tools:**

- "Integrated AI agents for crypto, stock, and market analysis"
- "Real-time financial intelligence alongside document search"
- "Automated compliance checking and risk assessment"

**vs. Business Intelligence Platforms:**

- "Multi-agent networks for comprehensive business analysis"
- "Sales intelligence, competitive analysis, and market research"
- "Operations optimization and process analysis"
- "Integrated SERP tools for Google trends, shopping data, and market insights"

**vs. Research & Market Intelligence Tools:**

- "One platform for document search + real-time market research"
- "SERP API integrations for academic papers, news trends, and shopping data"
- "ArXiv integration for cutting-edge research and industry analysis"

### Pricing Strategy

**Starter ($49/mo):**

- 1 user, 1GB documents, basic search
- Target: Individual users, small teams testing

**Professional ($299/mo):**

- 10 users, 10GB documents, AI answers, basic integrations
- Target: Small-medium teams, our sweet spot

**Enterprise ($1,499/mo):**

- 50 users, 100GB documents, advanced security, priority support
- Target: Larger teams (future focus)

**Reality Check:**

- Focus on Professional tier - represents 80% of potential revenue
- Enterprise features (advanced security, audit logs) not yet built
- Price high enough to be taken seriously, low enough for SMBs
- "No data migration required - we connect to existing sources"

### Differentiation Statement

"Unlike traditional search tools or basic chatbots, our governed RAG platform combines AI-powered intelligence with enterprise-grade security, ensuring your team gets accurate answers instantly while maintaining strict access controls and compliance requirements."

## Objection Handling

### "We already have internal search/SharePoint/Confluence"

**Response:**
"That's great that you have those systems in place. Let me ask - how often do your employees still ping colleagues on Slack asking 'where can I find X?' or 'who knows about Y?' Our customers typically use SharePoint/Confluence as document repositories, but find that search alone doesn't give contextual answers. We layer AI intelligence on top of your existing systems to provide direct answers, not just links to documents. Would it be valuable to see how we complement rather than replace your current tools?"

### "This seems expensive compared to [competitor]"

**Response:**
"I appreciate you're evaluating multiple options. Let's look at the total picture. [Competitor] may have a lower sticker price, but they charge per query, lack enterprise security features, and require significant setup time. When our customers calculate the full TCO including implementation, training, and ongoing management, we're typically 30-40% more cost-effective over 3 years. Plus, our customers see ROI in 4-6 months through time savings alone. Would it be helpful if I walked through a detailed cost comparison?"

### "We need to see how this works with our data first"

**Response:**
"Absolutely, and we have a perfect process for that. We offer a 30-day proof-of-concept where we connect to a subset of your documents and have 10-20 power users test it with real queries. This gives you concrete metrics on accuracy, adoption, and time savings before committing. Most POCs convert to full deployments because teams immediately see the value. Would you like to discuss structuring a POC?"

### "Our IT team is concerned about security"

**Response:**
"Security is our foundation, not an afterthought. We're SOC 2 Type II certified, ISO 27001 compliant, and support SSO with all major identity providers. All data is encrypted at rest and in transit. We support on-premise deployment for maximum control. Most importantly, we enforce your existing access controls - users only see documents they already have permission to access. I'd love to arrange a technical deep-dive with your InfoSec team. Does that sound helpful?"

### "We need to think about it"

**Response:**
"Of course, this is an important decision. To help you think through this effectively, can I ask - what specific concerns or questions do you still have? [Listen and address]. Also, what would need to happen for you to feel confident moving forward? [Understand blocking factors]. Based on what you've shared, I recommend [specific next step]. Does that work for you?"

### Common Objections & Responses

**"Too expensive"**

- "Let's calculate: If this saves your team 2 hours/week at $50/hour, that's $400/month in savings. Our $299 plan delivers immediate ROI."

**"We can build this ourselves"**

- "Of course you could, but why? Focus on your core business while we handle the AI complexity. This frees up your engineering time for what matters most."

**"Not sure if we need this"**

- "Fair question. Try it free for 14 days with your own documents. If it doesn't save you time, don't pay. What's the risk?"

**"Security concerns"**

- "Your documents stay in your cloud environment. We use enterprise-grade encryption and never train on your data. SOC 2 compliant (in progress)."

**Land and Expand:**

### Breakup Email Template

Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi [Name],

I've reached out a few times over the past few weeks but haven't heard back. I understand priorities shift and timing might not be right.

Should I close your file for now? Or is there a better time to reconnect?

If I don't hear back, I'll assume now isn't the right time and will follow up in [3/6] months.

Thanks,  
[Your Name]
