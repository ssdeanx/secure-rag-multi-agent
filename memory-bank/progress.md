# Progress (Updated: 2025-10-20)

## Done

- [2025-10-20] Removed incorrect single-tool-call assumption; updated memory bank to reflect agents can run async and may call multiple tools, with workflows/orchestrator providing sequencing and observability.

## Doing

- [2025-10-20] Awaiting user confirmation that memory bank now matches reality

## Next

- If confirmed: append decision to `decisionLog.md` and add small README in `memory-bank/` listing source files used for memory sync
