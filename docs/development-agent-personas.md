## OpenCode Agent Implementation Guide

### Overview

This section provides a comprehensive guide for implementing the 50 specialized agent personas using OpenCode's agent creation system. OpenCode offers a powerful, secure alternative to traditional MCP protocols through its Custom Tools feature, enabling direct AI-agent function calls without external dependencies.

### OpenCode Agent Architecture

**Agent Types:**
- **Primary Agents**: Core agents with full tool access (Build, Plan, etc.)
- **Subagents**: Specialized agents with restricted tool sets and custom prompts
- **Custom Tools**: Secure, user-defined functions callable by agents during conversations

**Key Benefits:**
- **Security**: No external processes or network dependencies
- **Customization**: Build exactly what your workflow needs
- **Zero Configuration**: File naming conventions automate tool registration
- **Complete Control**: Own the entire development stack

### Configuration Structure

Create an `opencode.json` configuration file in your project root:

```json
{
  "data": "directory",
  "providers": {
    "openai": {
      "apiKey": "your-api-key",
      "disabled": false
    },
    "anthropic": {
      "apiKey": "your-api-key", 
      "disabled": false
    }
  },
  "agents": {
    "code-review-agent": {
      "model": "claude-3.7-sonnet",
      "maxTokens": 5000,
      "prompt": "agents/code-review-agent.md",
      "tools": ["run_terminal_cmd", "read_file", "grep_search", "run_tests"]
    },
    "testing-agent": {
      "model": "gpt-4o",
      "maxTokens": 4000,
      "prompt": "agents/testing-agent.md", 
      "tools": ["run_terminal_cmd", "run_tests", "create_file", "read_file"]
    }
  },
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/home/sam/mastra-governed-rag"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### Custom Tools Creation

OpenCode's Custom Tools provide secure, direct function calls for agents. Create tools in the `.opencode/tools/` directory:

**Directory Structure:**
```
.opencode/
  tools/
    code-analysis.js
    test-runner.js
    security-scan.js
    performance-profile.js
```

**Example Custom Tool (code-analysis.js):**
```javascript
export default {
  name: "code-analysis",
  description: "Analyze code for quality, security, and performance issues",
  parameters: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      filePath: {
        type: "string",
        description: "Path to the file to analyze"
      },
      analysisType: {
        type: "string", 
        enum: ["quality", "security", "performance", "all"],
        description: "Type of analysis to perform"
      }
    },
    required: ["filePath"]
  },
  run: async ({ filePath, analysisType = "all" }) => {
    // Implementation logic here
    const results = {
      quality: await runQualityCheck(filePath),
      security: await runSecurityScan(filePath), 
      performance: await runPerformanceAnalysis(filePath)
    };
    
    return analysisType === "all" ? results : results[analysisType];
  }
};
```

### Agent Specialization Patterns

**1. Code Quality Agent Configuration:**
```json
{

    "model": "claude-3.7-sonnet",
    "maxTokens": 5000,
    "prompt": "agents/code-review-agent.md",
    "tools": ["run_terminal_cmd", "read_file", "grep_search", "run_tests", "code-analysis"]
  }
}
```
